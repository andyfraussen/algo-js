Exercise 4.1
Create a function named calcSurface that takes the length and width of a rectangle and returns its surface. Then create a program that asks the length and width of a rectangle to the user then displays the surface of that rectangle. That program must use the function you created.

Write a documentation for the calcSurface function.

Exercise 4.2
Create a function named rand10() that returns a random integer between 1 and 10. Create a program that will display the result of that function each time it is run.

Write a documentation for the rand10() function.

You will have to search on Google how to generate random numbers in JavaScript for this exercise.

Exercise 4.3
By reusing the function rand10() created in Exercise 2, write a function named multiRand(n) that returns an array of n numbers between 1 and 10. You should not modify anything in rand10() to achieve this.

Write a documentation for the multiRand(n) function.

Use that function to create a program that will ask the number of random numbers to generate then display that same number of random numbers.

Exercise 4.4
Create a function named average(arr) that takes an array of numbers as argument and returns the average.

Create a function named min(arr) that takes an array of numbers as argument and returns the minimum element.

Create a function named max(arr) that takes an array of numbers as argument and returns the maximum element.

Create a program that asks a number to the user then generate that same amount of random numbers but also displays their average, min and max. To do so, use the three functions you just created as well as the multiRand(n) function created in Exercise 3.

Write a documentation for all the functions you created.

Exercise 4.5
Create a function named calcDistance which takes the coordinates of two different points A and B in a 2D space. That function must return the distance between those two points.

Examples results:

Point A = [1, 1], point B = [2, 2] => 1.41
Point A = [1, 1], point B = [3, 1] => 2
Point A = [4, 1], point B = [1, 1] => 3
Point A = [-2, 2], point B = [2, -2] => 5.65
Create a program to use that function.

Write a documentation for the calcDistance function.

Note: You probably need to make some search on Google to learn the mathematical formula to do that. You will also probably need to search for useful functions in JavaScript to help you making complex mathematical formulas...

Exercise 4.6
Create a function factorial(a) that returns the factorial of a number.

That function must be recursive.
